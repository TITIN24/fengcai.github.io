My name is Feng Cai (Chinese: 蔡峰). I am now a 2nd-year postgraduate student of Fudan University (Shanghai, China), advised by Prof. Feng Wang. My main research interests is in neural network structure optimization, novel view synthesis, super resolution. I enjoy partnering with others to explore new ideas and approaches. My focus is on developing innovative solutions to real-world problemsI aspire to follow in the footsteps of great researchers who have developed groundbreaking technologies.
